Explaining factors behind Uttar Pradesh Assembly Election 2017, using R
_________________________________________________________________________
Uttar Pradesh assembly election 2017 is one of the most important and widely discussed
assembly election in 2017.it become media point of interest and well discussed and analyzed
assembly election among policy makers and political philosophers. The election to the 17th
Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly was held from 11 February to 8 March 2017 in 7 phases.
This election saw voter turnout of 61.04% compared to 59.40% in the previous election.
Bharatiya Janata Party won this election by an overwhelming three-quarter majority of 325
seats with the help of his large number of party workers despite not projecting a chief
ministerial candidate before the election. This project explains the factor influenced the
2017 UP assembly election using statistical predictive models.


Here we will conduct statistical data
analysis procedures and build some relevant statistical models to understand the personal
features or factors of the candidates which may influenced the result. We will create a major
dataset by collecting and merging candidateâ€™s data from different sources. Using different
statistical predictive models we will figure out different features of candidates which effect the
election outcome. Using these models we will also predict the winners and losers and the
factors behind the result. Most importantly we will use continues response prediction model
and classification based prediction models for predicting the winners and vote share.

a. Data cleaning & Data preparation

b. Split data into Development (70%) and Hold-out (30%) Sample

c. Build Classification Tree using CART technique

d. Build Model using Random Forest technique

e. Build Model using continues response prediction

f. Build Model using classification based prediction

g. Build model using Logistic Regression
